**PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS ESTIMATOR FOR A SINGLE PHASE INDUCTION MOTOR**

**OBJECTIVES**

•	To estimate the performance characteristics of single-phase induction motor such as efficiency, shaft torque and total losses. 

•	To determine the specifications of single-phase induction motor such as synchronous speed, frequency, input power and output power.

•	To analyse the characteristics of the motor such as rotor power, torque developed in forward and backward direction.
